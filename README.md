## Can I Trust It?

<br/>

Sure! I worked hard in my school classes and received good grades on most assignments and exams. Although there were some deductions or areas where I did not receive points, I received good scores on most assignments and exams. I will describe any areas where I did not receive full marks separately in the markdown.

## Contributing

<br/>

This archive is a personal collection of my coursework during my time at Sogang University, and as such, contributions are not currently being accepted. However, feel free to use the materials in this archive for your own educational purposes. If you have any questions about the materials or how they were created, please feel free to contact me. 

I'm afraid to inform that this GitHub repository consists of my own materials in undergraduate course, so the majortiy of code and reports are written in Korean.

<br/>

> Please be aware that the course materials and assignments may differ from what I learned during the time I took this course, as it was not during the current semester.
